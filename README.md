## About me

I am a dedicated data professional with a background in mathematics and education. Known for my resourcefulness, perceptiveness, patience and tenacity, I leave no stone unturned when tasked with producing useful and meaningful insights into all forms of data. Being proficient in Python and possessing a solid understanding of SQL, I leverage libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels and Matplotlib not only to draw insights into the data, but also to build data-driven tools. 

I am equally passionate about effectively communicating the results of my analytical work to stakeholders. In fact, I am able to leverage my background in education to ensure that my presentations are palatable to non-technical audiences, all while ensuring that all key results are diligently documented, communicated and, when possible, demonstrated.

Recently, I earned a diploma in data science and have been actively engaged in personal projects within the field. I am now eagerly seeking my next challenge, ready to apply my skills and knowledge in a dynamic professional setting.

When I am not coding up data pipelines, you may find me shooting a CQ DX on the 10m amateur radio band, gliding through a wintery landscape on my cross-country skis, working on my car or pitching a tent far up north.
